# Surge XT for Move Everything

Hybrid synthesizer module based on [Surge XT](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge) by the Surge Synth Team.

Wavetable, FM, subtractive, and physical modeling synthesis with 600+ factory presets.

## Features

- All Surge XT oscillator types: Classic, Wavetable, Window, Sine, FM2, FM3, String, Twist, Alias, S&H Noise
- Dual filters with multiple filter types
- 3 LFOs per scene with sine, triangle, square, ramp, noise, S&H, envelope, and step sequencer shapes
- Amplitude and filter envelopes
- 600+ factory presets across 15 categories
- Works standalone or as a sound generator in Signal Chain patches

## Limitations

- **Lua/Formula Modulator not supported** - Surge's Formula Modulator LFO shape requires LuaJIT, which is not included in this build. Patches that use Formula Modulator LFOs will still load and produce sound, but the formula-driven modulation will not be active. The Tutorials preset folder (which relies heavily on Formula Modulator) is excluded.
- **Scene B not exposed** - Only Scene A parameters are accessible. Scene B exists internally but is not routed to the UI.
- **No FX section** - Surge's built-in effects are not exposed (use Signal Chain audio FX instead).

## Prerequisites
